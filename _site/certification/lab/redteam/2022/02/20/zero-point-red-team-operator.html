<h2 id="course">Course</h2>

<p>The course as of today includes the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Course introduction</li>
  <li>Command &amp; Control</li>
  <li>External Reconnaissance</li>
  <li>Initial Compromise</li>
  <li>Host Reconnaissance</li>
  <li>Host Persistence</li>
  <li>Host Privilege Escalation</li>
  <li>Domain Reconnaissance</li>
  <li>Lateral Movement</li>
  <li>Credentials &amp; User Impersonation</li>
  <li>Password Cracking Hints &amp; Tips</li>
  <li>Session Passing</li>
  <li>Pivoting</li>
  <li>Data Protection API</li>
  <li>Kerberos</li>
  <li>Active Directory Certificate Services</li>
  <li>Group Policy</li>
  <li>Discretionary Access Control Lists</li>
  <li>MS SQL Servers</li>
  <li>Domain Dominance</li>
  <li>Forest &amp; Domain Trusts</li>
  <li>Local Administrator Password Solution</li>
  <li>Bypassing Defences</li>
  <li>Data Hunting &amp; Exfiltration</li>
  <li>Post-Engagement &amp; Reporting</li>
  <li>Extending Cobalt Strike</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I knew a bit more about active directory before I started the course but really enjoyed learning a bit more under the hood and <strong>LOVED the opsec considerations</strong> and to hunt for artifacts in the Splunk (now Kibana) instance.
The content is provided on the Thinkific platform which allows to track your progress and <strong>access even after the exam to the up to date content is provided</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="lab">Lab</h2>

<p>The lab is provided as a virtual environment through the provider <a href="https://www.snaplabs.io/">SnapLabs</a>.<br />
It can be started and stopped in a matter of minutes to use the lab hours efficiently.<br />
The access to the lab is provided via a web browser and the use of Apache Guacamole as the remote desktop solution.<br />
Sometimes copy paste was a hit or miss for me and the performance was good as long as the internet connection is stable.</p>

<h2 id="exam">Exam</h2>

<p>The exam has a lab time of 48 hours which can be used throughout 4 days in total.<br />
To pass the exam, <strong>6 out of 8 flags</strong> have to be collected.<br />
There is no report needed and I really enjoyed the chain in the exam and would have loved to continue in another environment.<br />
In my case I was able to collect all 8 flags within 13 hours.<br />
As soon as the 4 day time frame is over, the <strong>flags are automatically checked</strong> and if correct generate and send you your badge.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>£365.00</td>
      <td>Course Only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>£399.00</td>
      <td>Course + 40 hour lab bundle</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>RastaMouse did an amazing job to make the course even more accessible to someone investing private money by recently adding payment options that include splitting the payment into 4 separate payments.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>4 x £91.25</td>
      <td>Course Only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4 x £99.75</td>
      <td>Course + 40 hour lab bundle</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="final-verdict">Final verdict</h2>

<p>If you are willing to learn and grow in the area of red teaming, I highly recommend this course and certification.<br />
I had prior infrastructure assessment and active directory experience which made the course a bit easier.<br /></p>

<p><strong>But as the course page states:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The most successful students are not those with the greater technical knowledge - but those with a passion for learning new skills, solving problems, have great resilience and fortitude!</p>
